## Rock Paper Scissor Game Program
#### Kyi Lei Aye

### Program Overview
This program is a rock paper scissor game between user and computer and it depends on fate to be a winner!!

### Program Defination, Analysing, and Algorithms
1. Take the input of the number of rounds
2. Take the user's choice
3. Compare that choice to computer's
4. Output the winner 
5. Run the step 2, 3, 4 to the rounds number

### Implementation Design
1. Include directive for I/O stream
2. Declare the function
3. Define the function for computer choice
4. Declare the variables in main function to store user input values
5. Take user input values of the round numbers
6. Use while loop to run the process for the number of rounds times
7. Take user input and compare it to computer's choice

### Challenges
Parentheses in if/else statements can be confusing if it is not used properly.

### New features to learn in this program
1. Declaring Functions 
2. Function Calls
